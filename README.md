# My-Website

Hello! I'm FÃ¡bio Martins, and this is my personal website's source code! The prototype was created with `create-react-app` and the website itself was made with *ReactJS*, *TailwindCSS* and pure *CSS* for the animations and some classes. This project was made in order to test some of my skills and also to improve them, mostly my CSS skills and even TailwindCSS. This project will be constantly updated with new features, new animations, as I go deeper into the CSS and React world. If you have come this far and analysed the code, feel free to suggest some good practices I should implement and other stuff too. You can contact me directly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/f%C3%A1bio-martins-94aa0923a/) or you can send me an email to `fabio.martins.work@gmail.com`.

The website was deployed with **Firebase**!

Don't forget to actually visit my website!


### Small note

The home page is being evaluated, since it has a visual bug on PC and mobile. The initial page also has a small bug, where the animation is not triggered.

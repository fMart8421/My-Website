It started with simple games, like Tower Defense, and then it went to RPG's like Final Fantasy and Diablo, FPS and then MOBAs, like Smite. Not LoL because it is boring, change my mind. Oh, I've also played some games from FromSoftware and they were amazing."

        description:"Anime was a rather controversial hobby when I was in highschool... People would call those who watched anime \"Weebs\". Some still do, but I don't care as much now. It has actually become rather popular due to some titles like \"Attack on Titan\" and \"Demon Slayer\". For me it started with \"Naruto\" and from there on, it just raised and raised to the point where I've watched hundreds of anime... By the way, my favorite one is definitely \"Jujutsu Kaisen\", right next to \"Tokyo Ghoul\" (season 1 and the first episode of season 2)."

        description:"Something that came along with the Anime hobby, since it was annoying to watch an Anime without a continuation and the story was actually good (something like Bleach and Demon Slayer a few years back). First I did not like it because it was kind of bothersome only reading black and white squares. Then, as time went by, I started having more and more fun reading those black and white squares and then it became one of my main hobbies. It is also nice when they adapt something you've been reading for a while now. Nowadays I'm more of a Manhwa reader, which is the Korean version of Manga. It is colored, it has great drawings and the story is pretty neat too, what more could I wish for?"

        description:"I love the feeling of being physically tired after a good game, run, or workout, especially if it is with friends! My favorite sport is, without a doubt, volleyball. It started as hate tho. In middle school, I used to hate volleyball first because I sucked, second because everyone else sucked. The game would end before it even started. Then, in high school, things changed. The ball wouldn't fall instantly and everything started being more fun and I wasn't half bad after some little practice. In college, I joined the EI team in what was called \"Ta√ßa UA\", and started liking the sport even more! Now I don't have anyone to play it with tho, so I'm rather sad."

Why does this work like this?\" I would rather stay in class and read books than go play with the other kids! I find it unbelievable knowing how much I like to socialize nowadays, but these are the stories I'm told. Nowadays my curiosity is a bit more \"calm\" but whenever something piques it, I have to search it up, otherwise my soul will not rest..."
